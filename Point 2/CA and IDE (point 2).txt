For the code assitant I am using Codeium, this is because I had 
billing problems with GitHub Copilot so I decided to use Codeium as 
it is free and easier to install.

For the IDE I am using VS Code because it is the IDE I have the most experience
with so I will not have problems with extensions usage.


How the assistant helped me:
It was very helpful when writing "repetitive" pieces of code,
for example, for coding the prompts, I wrote the code for the first prompt
(reading the file, joing the sentences, calling the function, etc...)
and Codeium completed the rest of the prompts, even calling the correct files names.

Also while coding the API, it was helpful as I did not know the name for the
methods, and Codeium completed that with the things I had written.
